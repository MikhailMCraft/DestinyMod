--
Added perks and mods! (light level?)
New items will be created with randomly generated perks (subject to change, maybe command that brings old weapons to new system)
Mods can be purchased from Xur on a random rotation

Added MIDA Multi-Tool's exotic perk
Graviton Lance now only shoots 2 bullets
Thorn's Mark of the Devourer buff now reflects its in-game behavior better (increases burn damage by a fixed amount)
Vex Mythoclast's Overcharge buff now reflects its in-game behavior better (max charges at 6, charge shot reduces by 2, can only switch at max charge)
Divinity's Judgment buff now reflects its in-game behavior better (now causes affected enemies to always take critical damage, triggers buff quicker, removes it faster)
Added the last half of Ticuu's Divination's exotic perk (homing arrows apply Sacred Flame debuff, normal arrows detonate it)
Gjallarhorn's Wolfpack Rockets now fire off in the opposite direction of the main rocket on collision
Renamed Gjallarhorn's rockets from "Wolfpack Round" to "Wolfpack Rocket"
Xur has now been redone and should now sell items consistently
