Ported the mod to 1.4!
NOTE THAT THE MOD IS STILL IN A PRE-RELEASE STATE:
Issues we are aware of:
- Most items are no longer scaled down, resulting in some unreasonably large sprites
- Animated items have a mouse text hover well above their intended sprite (this is a tModLoader issue and we have a patch awaiting approval)
- Firing sounds for items such as Sweet Business are desynced from the bullets exiting the barrel (this is a tModLoader issue and we are waiting for a patch)
- Jotunn does not work as intended
- Grenades fired by Salvager's Salvo do not explode upon contact with an enemy

__DO NOT DELETE YOUR UNLOADED ITEMS__
__Instead, use the /portItems command to convert all unloaded TheDestinyMod items to DestinyMod items__

Additionally, the following changes were included in the 1.4 port:
Xur now appears every Friday if the world is in Hardmode
Gave all modded rocket launchers the generic rocket launcher sound
Monte Carlo now has its own sound effect
Resprited Divinity, Mote of Dark, Gjallarhorn, Impact Shard, and the Hakke weapons
Hakke weapons' bullets and Two-Tailed Fox's rockets now give off light
Implemented Nemesis Star's exotic perk
Decreased the ranged damage buffs Prodigal armor grants
Reworked the Drifter
Now grants Impact Shards every 10 Motes turned in
Fixed Motes of Dark dropping less than expected after using an Impact Shard
Motes now have a 5% chance to drop from enemies after using an Impact Shard (up from 4%)
Removed the Hakke Fusion Rifle
